#  RISC-V Learning Showcase – Silicon Shakti

> *“From instruction to silicon — mastering the layers of modern computing.”*

This repository documents my structured learning journey through the RISC-V architecture, from ISA foundations to RTL-level execution. Each week features a themed presentation cover to summarize the technical focus and demonstrate both depth and clarity — ideal for showcasing to recruiters, professors, or collaborators in the semiconductor ecosystem.
